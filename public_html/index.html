				<p id ="intro"><b>Name: </b>Yinmiao Li<br><br><b>Major: </b>Interactive Media Arts & Computer Science<br><br><b>Hobbies & Interest: </b><br>I love traveling, and experiencing different lifestyles. I'm always looking forward to exploring places with beautiful views or long histories. I've been to a lot of cities, Abu Dhabi and Prague are two of the cities I like the most. The photo I chose was taken in Abu Dhabi, when I went to a desert safari.<br> I have passion for music as well. I have interests and curiosity in musicals, rock (alternative rock, pop rock, metal, brit rock) and experimental electronic music, and I also listen to a lot of pop music. Because of my interest in music, I have done a lot of interactive projects related to music, such as simple audio visualization, computer music, NIME, etc. I would love to discuss about any music-related projects.<br>Besides, I also have interests in Education Technology. I do want to continue my career in HCI, and focusing on Education technology or music related interaction. I've made some related researches about music education and handwriting guidance and found it meaningful and interesting.
